# Guss The Number

The goal of the project is to make the user provide three inputs, the upper bound and the lower bound number, and the number of attempts to generate a random integer between the upper and lower number and providing the user as many attempts as specified by the user to solve it.

# Random

The project makes use of the Random module.

The python module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

In this project, the 'randint(a, b)' function of Random module has been used, which takes two integers a and b, and returns a random integers between the two.
